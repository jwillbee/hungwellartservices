            I can fully install your artwork in a gallery, home or office based on your specifications. Most hardware is provided with the exception of
            specialized installation materials.  The price of installation is contingent on the estimated amount of hours to install.  In the event that
            hand delivery is necessary (meaning I am going somewhere to pick up art or physically bringing art somewhere for you), travel is included in
            the estimate.<br>
            Price:  50.00 an hour.  I can hang approximately 10 works in an hour depending on what they are.<br><br>
            <h3>Curation</h3><br>
            I am always very happy to offer my input and advice on how or where work should be hung.  I’m also happy to help you make choices and lay out
            a show. I find those conversations very fun. It’s my favorite part. If I am asked to independently make the choices about where works are to
            be installed in a space I request a curation fee.  The curation fee is only applicable to events and not private homes or businesses.
            Price:  The curation fee is 10.00 per each work hung.  For example, if I curate 9 works, the curation fee is 90.00.<br>
            <h3>Deinstallation</h3><br>
            Deinstallation is significantly easier and can typically be achieved in under an hour.<br>
            Price: 50.00 per hour<br><br>
            <h3>Packaging</h3><br>
            Art works can be professionally packaged on site for storage or transport.<br>
            Price:  15.00 per artworks under 3’x3’
            20.00 per artworks larger than 3’x3’</p></div>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>I am an artist, curator, teacher and art handler.  I have 20 years of comprehensive experience facilitating the organization, curation and installation of art events.  I have hung or installed many different types of art with values well exceeding seven figures.  I have installed works in many different types of settings that include private homes, galleries, art fairs and businesses.  I have worked for and with organizations like Christie’s Auction House in Rockefeller Center, The Green Project in New Orleans and Frank’s Chop Shop in Rochester.  I have been with the Yards Art Collective since 2020. 

I offer the following services to assist in the various necessary steps to a successful art show.  This is an ‘a la carte’ menu designed to help you receive exactly the services you need to have a great event.  I can be as involved or uninvolved as you like in this process.  

Prices vary per service. If interested, an estimate is generated based on the amount of menu items and the size of the task.  Reduced prices are considered when compiling multiple tasks. This service is designed to fit the individual needs of anyone looking for assistance with hanging artwork in a space or coordinating an event focused around the visual arts.
